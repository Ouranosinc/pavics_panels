# Context

The CMIP6 ensemble has what is called a *hot model* problem ([Hausfather et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01192-2)). That is, many models have a high climate sensitivity, and taking an unweighted average of temperature changes from the model ensemble would yield a warming higher than best estimates based on multiple historical and paleoclimate observations. This dashboard presents various strategies to weigh CMIP6 models based on climate sensivity estimates. 

## Measures of climate sensitivity

**Climate sensitivity** 
: the global temperature increase following a doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, compared to pre-industrial levels (~260 ppm).


**Transient Climate Response**
: The temperature change at the moment that atmospheric CO2 has doubled in a scenario where CO2 increases at a rate of 1% each year (about 70 years).

**Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity**
: The temperature change once the climate has fully adjusted to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, so after thousands oy years to account for the slow response of oceans.

**Effective Climate Sensitivity**
: An approximation of the equilibrium climate sensitivity found by analysing the first 150 years of an abrupt 2xCO2 or 4xCO2 simulation, assuming linear climate feedbacks.
